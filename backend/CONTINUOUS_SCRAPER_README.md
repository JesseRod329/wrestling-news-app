# Continuous Cagematch Scraper

## Overview

The Continuous Cagematch Scraper is a comprehensive solution that ensures **ALL wrestling information displayed in your application is accurately scraped from Cagematch.net**. This system provides:

- ✅ **Real-time data scraping** from Cagematch.net
- ✅ **Automatic data validation** and quality checks
- ✅ **Continuous updates** to keep information fresh
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** and logging
- ✅ **Support for expanding** the wrestler database

## Why This System?

**Before**: Your application was using mock/placeholder data that wasn't accurate.

**After**: Every piece of information (ages, promotions, hometowns, ratings, etc.) comes directly from Cagematch.net and is continuously validated and updated.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
python run_continuous_scraper.py install
```

### 2. Expand Database to 100 Wrestlers

```bash
python run_continuous_scraper.py expand 100
```

### 3. Start Continuous Updates

```bash
python run_continuous_scraper.py update
```

### 4. Start Both Scraper and API

```bash
python run_continuous_scraper.py start
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `expand [count]` | Expand database to specified number of wrestlers |
| `update` | Start continuous daily updates |
| `summary` | Show database summary and quality metrics |
| `validate` | Validate all data quality |
| `install` | Install required dependencies |
| `start` | Start both scraper and API server |

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Scraping**
- Scrapes individual wrestler profiles from Cagematch.net
- Extracts: name, age, promotion, hometown, height, weight, ratings, etc.
- Uses proper User-Agent headers to respect the website

### 2. **Data Validation**
- Checks for required fields (name, age, promotion, hometown)
- Validates age ranges (16-80 years)
- Ensures rating votes meet minimum threshold
- Calculates quality scores for each wrestler

### 3. **Continuous Updates**
- Runs every 24 hours automatically
- Only updates wrestlers whose data is older than 24 hours
- Tracks update counts and data freshness
- Maintains comprehensive scraping statistics

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- Monitors data quality scores
- Tracks successful vs. failed updates
- Provides detailed logging and error reporting
- Ensures data integrity over time

## Database Structure

The system creates a `wrestling_database_continuous.json` file with:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "5.0",
    "created_at": "2025-08-15T...",
    "last_updated": "2025-08-15T...",
    "total_wrestlers": 100,
    "data_source": "Cagematch.net",
    "data_quality": "High - Continuous validation and updates"
  },
  "wrestlers": [
    {
      "id": "cagematch_9967",
      "name": "Roman Reigns",
      "cagematch_id": "9967",
      "age": "40 years",
      "age_numeric": 40,
      "promotion": "World Wrestling Entertainment",
      "hometown": "Pensacola, Florida, USA",
      "height": "6' 3\" (190 cm)",
      "weight": "264 lbs (120 kg)",
      "averageRating": 7.31,
      "total_votes": 1676,
      "scraped_at": "2025-08-15T...",
      "quality_score": 95.0
    }
  ],
  "scraping_stats": {
    "total_scrapes": 150,
    "successful_updates": 145,
    "failed_updates": 5,
    "data_quality_score": 92.5
  }
}
```

## Data Quality Metrics

### Quality Score Calculation
- **Required Fields**: 60% (name, age, promotion, hometown)
- **Data Validation**: 20% (age range, rating votes)
- **Bonus Points**: 20% (major promotion, rated wrestlers)

### Quality Levels
- **High Quality**: 80-100% (Green)
- **Medium Quality**: 60-79% (Yellow)
- **Low Quality**: 0-59% (Red)

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files
- `cagematch_scraper.log` - Detailed scraping logs
- Console output - Real-time status updates

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Total scrapes performed
- Successful vs. failed updates
- Data quality scores over time
- Last update timestamps
- Error rates and types

## Integration with Your Application

### 1. **Backend API**
The `wrestling_api.py` has been updated to use the continuous database:

```python
# Automatically loads the most recent continuous database
database = WrestlingDatabase()
```

### 2. **Frontend Display**
All wrestler information now comes from verified Cagematch data:
- Ages are accurate and current
- Promotions are verified
- Hometowns are real
- Ratings come from actual fan votes

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- Database updates automatically every 24 hours
- No manual intervention required
- Data stays fresh and accurate

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Update Intervals

```python
# In continuous_cagematch_scraper.py
scraper.continuous_update_cycle(interval_hours=12)  # Update every 12 hours
```

### Force Updates

```python
# Force update specific wrestler
scraper.update_wrestler_data("9967", force_update=True)
```

### Quality Thresholds

```python
# Adjust quality thresholds
scraper.min_rating_votes = 20  # Require more votes for reliable ratings
scraper.max_age_difference = 1  # Stricter age validation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: The scraper includes delays (1 second between wrestlers) to respect Cagematch
2. **Network Errors**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Data Validation**: Check logs for specific validation failures
4. **Memory Usage**: Database is loaded once and kept in memory for efficiency

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
python continuous_cagematch_scraper.py validate
```

### Check Database Health

```bash
# Get comprehensive database summary
python run_continuous_scraper.py summary
```
